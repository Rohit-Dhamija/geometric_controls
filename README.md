# geometric_controls

This repository contains implementation of Pure-Pursuit and Stanley path tracking algorithms on [Toyota Prius simulator](https://github.com/osrf/car_demo), using C++ and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) framework. The Velocity is controlled by using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) controller.<br />
